## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This repo is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data from 2017 to better understand to below questions:

1. What programming languages are most used to work in Latam?
2. What are most wanted programming language in Latam?
3. Which occupations were most popular in Latam?
4. Which Latam location has the highest career satisfaction?
5. Which Latam location has the highest salary?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Project1.ipynb - Notebook containing the data analysis.
survey_results_public_2017.csv - Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data.

### Data Understanding
The rows are the respondants to the survey, and the columns are the answer to the survey questions and is our variables. It contains data have a numerical, categorical and text types. Missing values and outliers are present in the variables.

### I. Summary
The following results are a brief summary for the 5 questions over the data exploration contained in the project:
- Brazil is the country with most presence in Latam.
- Javascript and Java are the most want language to work.
- Webdeveloper was the most occupation in 2017 on Latam.
- Brazil had the highest career satisfaction, followed by Mexico and Argentina.
- Puerto Rico had the highest salary in the region.
- Definely Latam doesn't reflected the Global salary growth.
